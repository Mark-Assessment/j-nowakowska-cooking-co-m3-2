## Introduction

The primary goals of Julia's Cooking Company website is to provide a web-based application that is intuitive and easy to navigate, and allows users to add, edit, search and delete recipes.

This is the third of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute.

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive, simple site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and SQL Database.

## UX

### User Demographic

The ideal user for this website is:

- New user
- Returning user
- Person interested in cooking/looking for recipes

### User-Stories

#### New User

1. As a new user, I want to be able to navigate to Sign-Up page to register an account.
2. As a new user, navigate the site intuitively.
3. As a new user, easily access recipes.

#### Returning User

1. As a returning user, I want to be able to access my account on the website.
2. As a returning user, I want the information I seek to be easily accessible, like recipe instructions.
3. As a returning user, I expect to function without errors.

#### Person with an interest in cooking

1. As a person with an interest in cooking, I want to be able to expand on my knowledge by finding relevant recipes.
2. As a person with an interest in cooking, I want to access a recipe site where I can share and edit my own recipes.
3. As a person with an interest in cooking, I want to easily navigate the entire site intuitively.

### Development-Planes

For the site to function as intended and fulfil its purpose for the user, the developer needs to develop all aspects of a functional web-based application. 

#### Strategy

Strategy incorporates user needs as well as product objectives. This website will focus on the following target audience, divided into three main categories:

- **Roles:**

  - New user
  - Returning user
  - A person with an interest in cooking

- **Demographic:**

  - people researching recipes
  - teens
  - adults

- **Psychographic:**
  - Any socioeconomic status and age group
  - Interested in cooking

The website needs to enable the **user** to:

- Add,Update and Delete Recipes :
  - Buttons on Nav bar to add catgeory and recipe
  - Buttons for Editting and Deleting records
  - Log/Sign in button (in relation to editting and deleting records)
  - Form to submit method, time and description of recipe 

The website needs to enable the **site manager** to:

- View the recipes added by different users
- Improve the site as necessary with various new features
