## Automated Testing

Both manual and automated testing are used to check if the project's code is written in a way the project works correctly.
Automated testing can be performed via a Python testing framework like Pytest. I am aware of the advantages the automated testing carries like high reliability, as it is run and performed by a programme as the code is developed and it is a lot quicker as hundreds of tests can be performed against the project in a short time frame.
Although more time-consuming, I have decided to utilise the manual way of testing as the project is quite small and I didnâ€™t have the time capacity in the project window to get automated testing set up correctly.
Manual testing checks if the project works by user stories by testing it in different browsers and resolutions. The testing can be performed manually by a potential user, code creator or another third party.

In a real-life scenario, I fully acknowledge I would use PyTest to further practice my skills with automated testing and make sure that errors are picked up early and corrected promptly.

### Code Validation

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) service was used to validate the `HTML` and `CSS` code used.
The []() service was used to validate Python.

## User testing

A few friends and family members were asked to review the page for user experience and to point out any bugs/issues. The input of this group led to small UX adjustments to improve the overall site appearance and user experience. Some of them included: Adding a Close button to the Delete modal, Adding color changes to buttons and graphics adjustments.
